## Week II report ParrotAI IPT

followed by little disscussion leading by Fredy the session was interesting from that discussion i have got that the only major 
different between ML and deep learning was in ML we have input data then data enginers need to extract the best features to attain 
better perfomance while in Deep Learnng we have an input data both classfication and features extraction done by model itself to 
atain best perfomance
 beside that there is a lot of field which Deep learning perfom well include
 Image captioning,Object Detection,
 Image style Transfer,Self driving cars,
 Machine translation ,Dignosys of Different Diseases like Pnemonia using Chest Xray images.

## Week II report ParrotAI IPT

followed by little disscussion leading by Fredy the session was interesting from that discussion i have got that the only major 
different between ML and deep learning was in ML we have input data then data enginers need to extract the best features to attain 
better perfomance while in Deep Learnng we have an input data both classfication and features extraction done by model itself to 
atain best perfomance
 * beside that there is a lot of field which Deep learning perfom well include
 * Image captioning,Object Detection,
 * Image style Transfer,Self driving cars,
 * Machine translation ,Dignosys of Different Diseases like Pnemonia using Chest Xray images.

You may ask yourself why now? There were no expart back in time the answer will be no since The biggest acomplishment of AI 
and Deep Learning are acompaned by availability of Big data,Increasing in  computational power by having alot of clouds 
computing device like google colab,Azure and so on,improving technology and major one is having open source tools and 
Modules like Tensorflow,Pytoch and models which are trained better in large data like Alexnet,VG,ImageNet and many more.

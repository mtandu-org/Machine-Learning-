# Machine-Learning ParrotAiIPT week 1 report
I learned about Machine learning which is the teqnique to program a computer to learn through data.
it has different types which are:
   Supervised learning,unsupervised,semi supervised learning and reinfocement learning
* in supervised learning we train our data to predict a new /unseen data with both input and output data
* in unsupervised learning we use unlabeled data to transform the interest in those data
* In reinfocement learning agent tend to percive its enviroment and choose the action based on maximizing the reward
  supervised learning problem
  
  On going i learned about  both classification and regression problems from supervised leraning here i grasp the knowledge to understand which kind of problem could be either classfication and regression in which :
 * classfication problem this train a model to do predition of with descrete output.it seems like yes/no preblem which can be solved with different ML models inlude Logistic regression,K-nearest neighbor,Random forest,Decision Tree,suport vector machine and neural net
 * Regression problem we train our model to predict continous value or float points values.this can be solved by the ML models which are Liner regression and logistic regression.
 
 Unsupervised Learning problem:this include classtering ,Dimensionality reduction and Association Rule
 - clustering algorithm:its train unlabeled data and clustering a data with similar characteristics .this can be solved with ML modes like K-Means ,Hierachical clustering Algorithm and Expected maximization
 - Dimensionality Reduction:is the simplification of a data without loss of information 
 - Association Rule :is the rule that express that if an event occur there is probability of other 
   event to occur. which can be solved by Apriori.
Reinforcement Learning:Agent perceive environment and choose action based on maximizing rewards or penalties for negative rewards example AlphaGo, self driving cars,
Semi supervised Learning: learning with a lot of unlabeled data and a bit labbed data ,this occur in the  photo hosting application 

Model based Learning: create a model and make prediction using a model ,we use utility function to measure how good our model is and cost function to measure how bad is , which it measure the diatance between predicted model and training .
Instance based :measure by checking similarity between two class.

Latly i leraned about  Challenges of ML
- Insufficient quality data 
- Poor quality data
- Irellevant features(good way to do is features engineering)
- Non represantative training data
#### In second case
I learned about Feature engineering which are techinique to choose the best feature to use in your data set,This can be done either by feature extraction and feature selection ,in which in feature selection we chose the best feature in our data set to train our model which can be achived by automatic feature selection Uvariate feature selection,model based feature selection and iterative feature selection which train model to remove recusive features.
 ### Lastly
 I learned about K Nearest Neighbor is the machine learning model train a model to determine a new unseen data belongs to which class in a training classes by cheking the ecludian distance between new data and the trained databy using the number of K with can be odd if your class is even to prevent equal votes in your model,More so implementation of it in python with both Iris dataset and Boston house price dataset.

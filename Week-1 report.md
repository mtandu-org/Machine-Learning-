# Machine-Learning ParrotAiIPT week 1 report
I learned about Machine learning which is the teqnique to program a computer to learn through data.
it has different types which are:
   Supervised learning,unsupervised,semi supervised learning and reinfocement learning
* in supervised learning we train our data to predict a new /unseen data with both input and output data
* in unsupervised learning we use unlabeled data to transform the interest in those data
* In reinfocement learning agent tend to percive its enviroment and choose the action based on maximizing the reward
  supervised learning problem
  
On going i learned about  both classification and regression problems from supervised leraning here i grasp the knowledge to understand which kind of problem could be either classfication and regression in which :
* classfication problem this train a model to do predition of with descrete output.it seems like yes/no preblem which can be solved with different ML models include Logistic regression,K-nearest neighbor,Random forest,Decision Tree,suport vector machine and neu*al net
* Regression problem we train our model to predict continous value or float points values.this can be solved by the ML models which are Linear regression and logistic regression.
 
More so I jumped over Unsupervised learning problem,this is where the full meaning of differentiate supervised from unsupervised learning and trying to understand different unsupervised learning problem as i mentioned a little bit about it below. Unsupervised Learning problem:this include classtering ,Dimensionality reduction and Association Rule
* clustering algorithm:its train unlabeled data and clustering a data with similar characteristics .this can be solved with ML modes like K-Means ,Hierachical clustering Algorithm and Expected maximization
* Dimensionality Reduction:is the simplification of a data without loss of information 
* Association Rule :is the rule that express that if an event occur there is probability of other 
   event to occur. which can be solved by Apriori.
   
Reinforcement Learning This was a little bit easier to me because i learned it in my Artificial interlligent cause  and was short part like introducing about agents ,enviroment and actions after perciving its enviroment by different sensors that agent have to optimize the rewards. these may be seen in different agent AlphaGo,self driving cars,Alexa and so on. And here i got the muscles on semi supervised learning in which trying to tell oubout having a model with alot of unlabed data and a bit of labed data, as you can see combines both supervised by having unlabed data on it and other hand is supervised.This could be seen on photo hosting engine like google photos.

Few days back I learned about Feature engineering which are techinique to choose the best feature to use in your data set,This can be done either by feature extraction and feature selection ,in which in feature selection we chose the best feature in our data set to train our model which can be achived by automatic feature selection Uvariate feature selection,model based feature selection and iterative feature selection which train model to remove recusive features.

 ### Lastly
 I learned about K Nearest Neighbor is the machine learning model train a model to determine a new unseen data belongs to which class in a training classes by cheking the ecludian distance between new data and the trained databy using the number of K with can be odd if your class is even to prevent equal votes in your model,More so implementation of it in python with both Iris dataset and Boston house price dataset.

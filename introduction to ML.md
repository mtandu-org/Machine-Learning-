## Machine Learning 
Machine Learning : is the science of program a computer so that it can learn from the data.
#### Where to use machine Learning
- In a problem with existing solution with a long list of a rules
- in a complex problem with no solution yet.
- in fluctuating environment 

#### Types of ML
- supervised learning
- unsupervised learning
- reinforcement learning
- semi supervised learning
- model based learning
- instance based learning

supervised learning:is the  ML type in which both input and output data are trained to predict new data. Forexample  email filter, face recognition,natural language processing 
#### supervised Learning problem
- classification problem:Is the learning problem which work as yes/no question ,train data to predict whether something can occur or not.
- regression problem:is the one in which both input and output value trained to predict a numeric value or floating point or continuous value. Forexample predict a car prices based on the car features.
#### Supervised Learning algorithm 
  classification  algorithms
   - K-Nearest Neighbor 
   - Linear regression
   - Logistic regression
   - Decision Tree and Random Forrest 
   - Suport vector machines (SVM)
   - Neural Net
  Regression algorithms
  - Linear regression
  - Logistic  Regression
  #### Unsupervised Learning
 Unsupervised Learning:is the type of learning that transform the interest in a raw data(unlabeled data), forexample classification of the blog visitor without classify a visitor belong to a certain group.
#### Unsupervised Learning problem
 - clustering algorithm:its train unlabeled data and clustering a data with similar characteristics 
 - Dimensionality Reduction:is the simplification of a data without loss of information 
 - Association Rule :is the rule that express that if an event occur there is probability of other 
   event to occur 
#### Unsupervised Learning algorithm
 - Clustering algorithm
   - K-Means 
   - Hierachical clustering algorithm
   - Expected Maximization 
 - Dimensionality reduction  algorithm
 - Association Rule algorithm 
   - Apriori
Reinforcement Learning:Agent perceive environment and choose action based on maximizing rewards or penalties for negative rewards example AlphaGo, self driving cars,
Semi supervised Learning: learning with a lot of unlabeled data and a bit labbed data ,this occur in the  photo hosting application 

Model based Learning: create a model and make prediction using a model ,we use utility function to measure how good our model is and cost function to measure how bad is , which it measure the diatance between predicted model and training .
Instance based :measure by checking similarity between two class.

#### Challenges of ML
- Insufficient quality data 
- Poor quality data
- Irellevant features(good way to do is features engineering)
- Non represantative training data
